Individuals served by the public mental health system are dying, on average, 25 years earlier than the general population. This is largely due to chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, and other obesity- and smoking-related diseases. These illnesses are worsened by years of malnutrition, living out in the harsh elements, and limited access to preventive health care. Pathways to Housing DC originated as a mental health and substance abuse provider. We have grown our partnerships with primary care providers and other local nonprofits over the past few years, recognizing that physical health and mental health are inextricably linked. We are committed to growing life expectancy and improving the health of the individuals we serve.\n\nTimely access to healthcare and health education greatly impact an individual’s ability to recover, live longer, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We currently provide integrated mental health and primary care services to all Pathways clients through an on-site, walk-in clinic via our partnership with Unity Health Care (the District’s largest Federally Qualified Health Center). The program has impacted the lives of the people we serve by increasing their awareness of, and adherence to, healthy behaviors and independence in managing their healthcare needs.

The team provides assistance and support throughout the job search, application, interview, and onboarding process.  That support continues into each person’s new career, for as long as it is needed, with teams offering counsel and advice as each person adjusts to their new work routine. Our Supported Employment program also operates quarterly workshops, as well as other ongoing support services that are tailored to each individual’s needs.

They can include occupational therapists and speech-language therapists, as well as experts from fields such as developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, autism spectrum disorder and sleep disorders.\nSpecialized Care\nIdentifying mental health issues in children is complex. Children’s National offers two care paths that draw on multiple resources for your child.\n\nComprehensive Assessment and Intervention\nComprehensive assessment and intervention services help with a broad range of behavioral issues and stressful conditions that may affect infants through the first years of life. Parents or medical providers, may have concerns about:\n\nAggression\nAnxiety\nExposure to loss\nFeeding problems\nIrritability\nMoodiness\nNeglect\nSleeping difficulties\nViolence\nWithdrawn behavior\nYou child’s first meeting with specialists may last up to two hours. It will include a psychiatric assessment. At that time we observe your child during a play session and cleaning up toys afterward. After this meeting, we give general feedback and advice for parents.\n\nThe underlying reasons for a child’s distress and/or behaviors can be complex.\n\nA thorough evaluation usually requires at least three visits. Afterward we may recommend or provide:\n\nConnections to school and community resources. We provide referrals for school-based services, such as DC Early Stages, Maryland Child Find, and Virginia Infants and Toddlers Connections. We also work with school administrators to help them provide services for your child. That can include letters of recommendation for school-based interventions, such as individualized educational plans (IEP), and referrals to educational advocates such as the Children’s Law Center.\nDaycare or preschool consultations\nIndividual treatment strategies. This can include highly effective approaches such as parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT), which is provided by PCIT-certified therapist Leandra Godoy, Ph.D.. Applied behavioral analysis (ABA) can result in positive behavior changes in children with autism spectrum disorder. We also may recommend play therapy.\nMedication, if needed. Some children benefit from medications focused specifically on their condition. Psychiatrist Bhavin Dave, M.D., can prescribe the right medication for your child and monitor how he or she responds.\nMultidisciplinary care. We can connect you and your child with other providers, such as specialists in autism spectrum disorder, developmental psychology, developmental pediatrics, speech-language therapy, and occupational therapy. We may also refer your child to our Sleep Center.\nEducation for parents. Experts at Children’s National help parents understand how issues such as developmental delays and medical problems can lead to emotional or behavioral issues in young children. They also explain your child’s specific diagnosis and how it usually affects children as they grow.\nParenting support groups. Our parent support group gives parents an opportunity to share and learn from each other in an atmosphere of compassion, respect, confidentiality and mutual support.\nFeeding Disorders\nOur multidisciplinary feeding disorders team was established more than 15 years ago. Since then it has helped hundreds of families.\n\nFeeding disorders in infants and young children under the age of 6 can come from a physical problem, an emotional issue or both. Assessment and care for infants and young children with these disorders can help them avoid health problems and improve their emotional well-being as they grow. Feeding disorders can include:\nOvereating\nRefusing to eat\nAversions to specific foods\nSpitting up or vomiting in infants\nDifficulty sucking or swallowing in infants\nGastro-esophageal reflux\nChildren with these problems may weigh too much or too little, or be normal weight. Infants may fail to gain weight and thrive. Older children may fall behind the normal growth curve.\n\nNew patients are first seen by a nurse specialist in gastroenterology. This nurse will consider your child’s medical, behavioral and nutritional issues. We also look at how well your child can control his or her lips, tongue and jaw muscles (oral-motor development). This screening will include a physical exam.\n\nAfter the initial report from the nurse specialist, your child will have visits with specialists in several areas of care relevant to his or her condition. We may look further into his or her oral-motor and psychiatric issues. At this time, we will observe your child from behind a one-way mirror as he or she eats and plays.\n\nOnce we complete the comprehensive evaluation, the entire team meets with you to provide feedback. Our recommendations can include:\n\nGuidance for parents in feeding management\nMedical treatment\nOral-motor therapy\nReferral to day treatment or inpatient care, if needed','https://childrensnational.org/departments/infant-and-toddler-mental-health-program-itp','','active','','For a new appointment for comprehensive assessment and intervention, call 202-476-5544.

For the past decade, we have successfully engaged, housed, supported, and treated over 850 adults who had been living on the streets for years. As an alternative to a system of emergency shelter/ transitional housing, our model is simple: provide housing first, and then combine that permanent housing with supportive treatment services in the areas of mental and physical health, substance abuse, education, and employment.\n\nWhile the model is simple, the Housing First Program is very complex and requires dedicated staff to coordinate all aspects (outreach, housing, healthcare, treatment and case management) of the program in order for the people we serve to be successful in their recoveries. Housing First means there are no conditions that have to be met before the person moves in. Housing is provided in apartments that are spread throughout the District, with each client holding their own lease. Using “scattered sites,” we are able to give each client choice in where they would like to live, helping to foster a sense of home and self-determination. Stable, supportive housing is merely the first step towards reintegrating into their community, rebuilding family relationships, reconnecting with their faith fellowships, and experiencing an improvement in overall physical health and psychological wellbeing.\n\nAfter receiving housing first, every client is matched with a support team (Assertive Community Treatment Team, Veterans Housing First Team and/or Permanent Supportive Housing Team) comprised of psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, certified addictions counselors, employment specialists, and peer health specialists. The team works together to provide comprehensive community-based treatment and support services around the clock, with a focus on integrating both health and social well-being into the recovery plan. These vital interventions are designed to empower client choice and support successful independent living. Using this model, we have been able to maintain a housing retention rate of at least 91% with clients who have traditionally been viewed as “treatment resistant,” and “not ready for housing.” We believe that housing is a basic human right, that anyone who says they want a safe place to live is “housing ready,” and that virtually all people can be successful in housing with the proper combination of supports. Our success using the Housing First model demonstrates that the vast majority of people we connect with permanent supportive housing stay in that housing and on the path to recovery.','https://pathwaystohousingdc.org/what-we-do/housing-first/','','active','','We do not accept direct referrals for this program.

Each year we welcome young people from colleges, schools, parishes, and other programs who not only serve as volunteers, but also live at The Father McKenna Center for a week at a time. This program is often an Alternative Spring Break or an Outreach Program for students who come to the Center on Saturday or Sunday, and stay through the following weekend.\n\nOur volunteers are not bystanders, rather they eat their meals in common with the men we serve, work in the Center, and support all aspects of our program. They sleep in the program area in the former church basement (often on pews or air mattresses they bring), take time to reflect on their experiences of service, and often have supplementary learning experiences at other organizations that support people experiencing homelessness (e.g. The Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless). The week of service frequently culminates in a day of advocacy as our visitors meet with their representatives or staff in the US Congress – just steps away from The Father McKenna Center.\n\nWe believe the experience of immersive service plays a vital role in breaking down societal barriers, teaches about individuals as well as issues, and equips our young visitors with tools for compassionate engagement as they return to their own communities.\n\nAs one of our visitors from The University of Notre Dame observed, “When I arrived, the homeless were a demographic.

To do this, VIDA has a licensed nutritionist / dietitian who supervises the food services of our participants. Our nutritionist also offers nutritional and diet counseling individually and in groups. The nutritionist works in coordination with the Health Promotion Counselor to put emphasis on people with high risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. Individual and group counseling are done with the objective of helping participants establish a healthy diet, by promoting informed decisions regarding their food. It is always emphasized that a healthy diet helps prevent and manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. In addition to the classes, the nutritionist also offers demonstrates of healthy cooking. Depending on the season and seasonal vegetables or fruits, healthy meals are prepared. The nutritionist regularly uses food from the Food Bank box so that we teach participants how to use those ingredients in the healthiest way possible. Participants are also educated on important issues related to nutrition such as: learning to keep food in good condition; modify recipes to make them healthier; improve decisions when buying food; use healthy portions of meals; and pay attention to their weight. They are often reminded of the importance of having breakfast and not skipping meals to avoid spikes and drops in sugar levels. In addition to that, VIDA gives breakfast to 50 participants in our two centers. We do not have a subsidy to provide breakfast, but for the past year VIDA has obtained private donations of bread and cereals that allow us to deliver breakfast in the morning to 50 people. In addition, we offer free lunch to about 120 people daily.

Sometimes this happens because of their children have other responsibilities as parents and have to take care of their own families. Also, in the case of older adults who are immigrants, when getting older they are disconnected from their networks and family members in their country of origin. In many cases, this isolation ends up generating chronic episodes of depression. Likewise, the life of the elderly is usually accompanied by many economic concerns, especially when it comes to immigrants with limited resources, who did not accumulate a sufficient pension to meet their basic needs. Not being able to pay the house bills or the costs of their health bills generates a lot of anxiety. In the case of most of our participants, who are first-generation immigrants, linguistic isolation is added to all of the above. Feeling that they cannot communicate well with the society that surrounds them or that they cannot function as they normally do is a very common stress generator in immigrants. To handle these situations, VIDA offers daily individual counseling and group counseling aimed at training older adults to manage stress and anxiety. We try to break the taboo barrier and understand that we all are exposed to situations of anxiety and that in the midst of problems, we must have tactics that help us relieve tensions. And to complement group and individual counseling, Vida also offers daily Tai-chi exercise classes, in which older adults learn to breathe and relax the tensions that manifest in their body. Vida Senior Centers puts special emphasis on mental health, because this can trigger other effects on the well-being of the person.

Often homeless and disabled, these veterans lack the most basic essentials: safe and affordable housing, healthcare, subsistence income or a job and protection from exploitation or violence. Many of their problems have legal dimensions and can be alleviated or resolved with the help of a lawyer.\n\nLaunched in 2015 in response to a fragmented and inadequate network of legal assistance for destitute veterans, the VLAP provides a gateway to legal and other services for this highly vulnerable population. An NLSP Staff attorney serves as the VLAP Project Manager. The project is overseen by the Capital Area Veterans Legal Services Collaborative, a group of legal services providers and law firms in the DC area who seek to improve the accessibility, scope and delivery of effective, free civil legal services to homeless and low-income veterans.','http://www.nlsp.org/services/veterans',' veterans.project@nlsp.org','active','','Call or walk in during intake hours for an intake.

They let people know about what warming sites are available, distribute cold-weather accessories, and check for signs and symptoms of hypothermia.\n\nThe Hypothermia Outreach Team was featured on NPR and Georgetown University put together this informational video. Take a few minutes to listen, watch and learn more about how the team works and how they interact with people on the street.\n\nSaving Lives Through Street Outreach\n\nOften, we encounter the same individuals week after week during our street outreach rounds. We always stop to say hello and ask if they need anything from us, and often the most service-resistant individuals will always dismiss us. “No, I’m fine. I don’t need anything.” Still, we persist week after week and become a familiar face and trusted source for help.\n\nMickey was a man we encountered every week sitting outside of the same store in Georgetown. We’d always say hello and ask if he needed anything, but he’d always say no, and we’d move on.\n\nOne day when we were walking with Dr. Crosland, our general practitioner, Mickey switched his answer from no to yes.

Mickey stayed in the hospital for several days before being discharged.\n\nThis is why we continue to do street outreach week after week and talk to people, even if they always tell us they don’t need help.

RSP collaborates with youth, their families, and community partner staff to improve their understanding of trauma/loss and allow them to develop coping skills that are healthy and practical.  Weekly sessions provide youth and their families the space to process their experiences and discover their innate resilience.\n\nResilient Scholars Project – School Based (RSP-SB) Services\n\nRSP-SB Services are grounded in evidence-based treatment models such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), play therapy, and mindfulness. The program empowers children and adolescents by highlighting their existing strength.  Throughout the school year, RSP clinicians facilitate group and individual therapy services using games, art, experiential activities, writing, and other modalities that explain concepts to participants in developmentally appropriate ways.  As part of RSP-SB Services, RSP clinicians also provide trainings to partner staff on incorporating trauma and bereavement informed practices into their environments. \n\nResilient Scholars Project – Home Based (RSP-HB) Services\n\nRSP-HB Services are designed to supplement RSP-SB Services by engaging entire families in the treatment process.  Using the trauma adapted family connections (TA-FC) model, RSP clinicians also aim to help families improve access to needed resources, increase safety skills, reduce youth absenteeism from school, and/or improve youth grades over a period of six months.  RSP clinicians build on the treatment models used in RSP-SB Services by incorporating principles from narrative therapy, motivational interviewing, and family systems therapy to work toward goals established with each family.  By participating in activities, games, and conversations that help families learn about trauma/loss, families also work toward improving communication and family cohesion.','https://www.wendtcenter.org/c-h-i-l-d-resilient-scholars/','','active','','To become a client, please call: 202.204.5021','','','',''),('594081408024759','643509042901798','','Pathways Home Montgomery Country','','In September of 2017 Pathways to Housing DC was chosen as one of thirteen programs nationwide to be awarded a five-year innovation grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

The District Government recognizes this and in response Mayor Bowser signed legislation for two new lead water service line replacement programs that assist homes affected by this environmental hazard:\n\n1. Full Lead Pipe Replacement\nIn October, 2019, the District transferred $1 million to DC Water to cover the complete cost of the lead water service pipe replacement on private property when DC Water replaces the portion of lead pipe in public space during a Capital Improvement Project (i.e., water main replacement).\nNOTE: Customers do not need to apply to this program and DC Water will contact you if there are any planned projects in your neighborhood.\n\nIf both the public and private portions of the service line are lead and no capital improvement is scheduled for two years, property owners can enroll in the Voluntary Lead Service Pipe Replacement Program. Applications will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis and this program is subject to the availability of funding.\n\n2. Private-side Partial Lead Pipe Replacements\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2020 (October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020), the District has allocated $1.8 million dollars to provide assistance for the replacement of lead pipes on private property if the pipe in the public space is not lead. The Lead Pipe Replacement Assistance Program (LPRAP) uses District funds to assist with eligible property owner’s lead pipe replacement. Each property owner can receive 50% of their costs covered (up to $2,500), regardless of income.

They may live and dress in ways typical of another gender (gender non-conformity), and some may experience the need to live and be affirmed as this gender in some or all settings. This can be an urgent need, or for others, there may be experimentation and exploration. There are also some young people who show gender non-conformity in their everyday behaviors, but may not yet have the self-advocacy skills to discuss their gender identity and their gender-related needs. Each child\'s gender journey is unique.\n\nThe gender development of a child may be confusing to parents and families, providers, and sometimes young people themselves. Parents may wonder:\n\nHow can my child\'s gender-related needs best be supported?\nHow do we navigate our child\'s gender diversity in everyday life (e.g., with family, in school, when moving into adulthood, etc.)?\nIs my child transgender?\nWill my child\'s gender and gender-related needs change over time?\nThe needs of gender-diverse youth are often complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team approach and ongoing care supports over time.\n\nAbout Us\nThe Gender Development Program at Children\'s National has been supporting the gender needs of youth and their families for the past 20 years. As one of the earliest founded youth gender programs, we are a multidisciplinary team of specialists who work in the assessment and broad care needs of youth on the gender spectrum and their families. We also conduct cutting-edge research to move forward our understanding of youth gender development and ways to best support gender-diverse and transgender youth. Research findings inform all of our clinical care.\n\nWe work with gender exploring, gender non-conforming, gender dysphoric, gender non-binary, transgender and gender-questioning young people, and we see children and adolescents of all ages. We also work with youth who have genetic and other conditions in which gender variation is common.\n\nWe offer:\n\nPersonalized evaluations and tailored care: This includes evaluation of your child\'s gender development and needs in the real world. Throughout care with us, your child will receive supports tailored to their unique needs, in coordination with an existing community of professionals your child already sees to ensure continuity and consistency of care.\nComprehensive services and collaboration with multiple specialties: From initial and ongoing evaluation and support to specialists in medical treatments such as Veronica Gomez-Lobo, M.D., a pediatric gynecologist who provides medical interventions such as puberty suppression or hormone therapy, the program offers a full spectrum of care options based on the needs of each young person.\nUnique programs for diverse needs:\nChildren and teens who have both autism spectrum characteristics (or related conditions) and gender dysphoria have access to a support program designed specifically for them: the Gender and Autism Program led by John Strang, Psy.D. Many providers refer patients to our program to access these services, which may not be offered elsewhere.\nThe Gender Development Program works closely with the Youth Pride Clinic, which offers primary and specialty care services to LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning/queer) patients.\nEvaluation and Ongoing Supports\nYour child’s care will start with an initial evaluation by our team. During this two to three-hour visit, you will meet the team together with your child and also separately.

While DC has a Hypothermia Hotline, many of our guests do not feel safe in emergency shelter environments, and there is not support for their transition through homelessness, only maintenance of their status quo.\n\nOur Hypothermia/Transition Program is application based, and each applicant meets with his Case Manager to ensure commitment to the goals and structure of the Program. Men are approved for participation in the Program based on an assessment of their readiness to move toward the next step on their journey out of homelessness, whether that step is a job, a temporary or permanent housing situation, or stability on the road to sobriety or mental health.\n\nWe open on November 1st and operate every night until March 31. The Hypothermia/Transition Program offers the men shelter for the night, a shower, a home-cooked evening meal, and time to work on their personal plan or to socialize.\n\nThe Program has two exceptional characteristics: it builds a cohort and it reintroduces family interactions.\n\nEach year we provide shelter for a consistent group of 18-20 men. This is not a drop-in program, rather the same men join us each night until they find stable housing or reunite with their community. This opportunity to build a bond of trust in a predictable environment cannot be underestimated. The state of homelessness is characterized by chaos and, too often, by fear. We believe the Hypothermia/Transition Program offers a place of not just physical shelter. It also provides a mental and emotional place of safety that allows each man to focus on moving his life forward.\n\nThe success of the Hypothermia/Transition Program is made possible by the consistent and loving support of the Gonzaga Mothers’ Club (GMC). Each season, the GMC and their families commit to cooking and serving the evening meal for 20 men for over 150 nights! Even more remarkable, this is not simply a drop-off service. The meals are brought to the Center by families, who then stay to serve and eat with the men. The act of breaking bread together, sharing conversation, and engaging as brothers and sisters in Christ breaks down barriers and allows everyone at the tables to see each other as individuals. This removal of the us/them divide is a tremendous gift for both our guests and our volunteers.','https://fathermckennacenter.org/what-we-do/hypothermia-program/','info@fathermckennacenter.org','active','','Have to be approved in an application process.
